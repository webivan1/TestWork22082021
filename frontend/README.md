# Little Emperors Test
## FRONTEND
Using the backend API created in the backend test, build a ReactJS web app to display the list of hotels.
The app should consist of an single listing page displaying the name, image, city and stars for each hotel.
The design is completely up to you but don't worry too much about it, something very simple is fine. Feel free to use for example bootstrap css classes or any design template.
